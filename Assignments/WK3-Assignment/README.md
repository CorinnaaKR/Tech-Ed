THOUGHTS THROUGHOUT
Followed through the demo, and created a template structure to follow and wrote out the pseudo code.
Had a look through pixabay and found a cartoon cookie image that I like and added to my html file.
Changed the image to a hungry octopus as I thought it more fun.
Created a folder to put my image in and linked the file path to make the image more easily accessible.
Have created sections and divs to divide my webiste into the sections i want and given them ids and classes to help with styling later.
Found a youtube tutorial to help me put the steps together the steps, as I understand which concepts I need to use but I am getting overwhelmed with how they work together.
Rubber ducked with Manny to understand the logic of the event handler, kept getting caught up and confused with the syntax. Managed to get there, now moving on to creating the elements for shop upgrades.
Went back through the class demos on DOM manipulation to figure out the code for making the new elements required for the elements.
Got stuck with the syntax, Manny pointed me towards the class demos for pulling the data from APIs. My code isnt showing any errors but the upgrades arent showing in my browser.
Asked chapgpt to, without giving me any code or telling me the answer, why the upgrade information from the API wasn't appearing in my browser. The response indicated a spelling error, and confirmed my own thought that I needed a return value to make the API information reusable.
Jumped on discord with Flavia, Will and Sam, they helped me work out why my buttons weren't appearing on the browser - we managed to get the buttons appearing but had to brainstorm and consult chatGPT on why it wouldnt append the child getUpgrades - we eventually worked out it was because the div 'shop container' that we were trying to append to I had labelled as a class not an Id.
Reviewed the demo workshops for intervals and local storage, then rubberducked to my classmates about the steps I wanted to happen, which variables I think I needed to call for the functions, and worked out, with some prompting, how i need to write those functions and call them. Each step, we checked in the console to check the functionality and watched out for any errors.
I then discussed the strech goal i wanted to achieve and spitballed how that would work. Before looking at achieving this, I went back to the user stories to check what needed to be achieved and marked the ones I had achieved with _DONE_. As there are still two user stories I haven't done, I'm going to review my previous assignment for the responsive web design elements that I want to incude.
Now playing around with the styling and layout. Asked Will on discord why my items aren't moving and he suggested setting a height and width to the page so the items have space to play with.
Realised I hadn't added the feature where the upgrades reduces the number of clicks so Sam helped me do by explaining the conditionals.
