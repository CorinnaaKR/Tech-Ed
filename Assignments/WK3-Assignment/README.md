THOUGHTS THROUGHOUT
Followed through the demo, and created a template structure to follow and wrote out the pseudo code.
Had a look through pixabay and found a cartoon cookie image that I like and added to my html file.
Changed the image to a hungry octopus as I thought it more fun.
Created a folder to put my image in and linked the file path to make the image more easily accessible.
Have created sections and divs to divide my webiste into the sections i want and given them ids and classes to help with styling later.
Found a youtube tutorial to help me put the steps together the steps, as I understand which concepts I need to use but I am getting overwhelmed with how they work together.
Rubber ducked with Manny to understand the logic of the event handler, kept getting caught up and confused with the syntax. Managed to get there, now moving on to creating the elements for shop upgrades.
Went back through the class demos on DOM manipulation to figure out the code for making the new elements required for the elements.
Got stuck with the syntax, Manny pointed me towards the class demos for pulling the data from APIs. My code isnt showing any errors but the upgrades arent showing in my browser.
Asked chapgpt to, without giving me any code or telling me the answer, why the upgrade information from the API wasn't appearing in my browser. The response indicated a spelling error, and confirmed my own thought that I needed a return value to make the API information reusable.
Jumped on discord with Flavia, Will and Sam, they helped me work out why my buttons weren't appearing on the browser - we managed to get the buttons appearing but had to brainstorm and consult chatGPT on why it wouldnt append the child getUpgrades - we eventually worked out it was because the div 'shop container' that we were trying to append to I had labelled as a class not an Id.
Reviewed the demo workshops for intervals and local storage, then rubberducked to my classmates about the steps I wanted to happen, which variables I think I needed to call for the functions, and worked out, with some prompting, how i need to write those functions and call them. Each step, we checked in the console to check the functionality and watched out for any errors.
I then discussed the strech goal i wanted to achieve and spitballed how that would work. Before looking at achieving this, I went back to the user stories to check what needed to be achieved and marked the ones I had achieved with _DONE_. As there are still two user stories I haven't done, I'm going to review my previous assignment for the responsive web design elements that I want to incude.
Now playing around with the styling and layout. Asked Will on discord why my items aren't moving and he suggested setting a height and width to the page so the items have space to play with.
Realised I hadn't added the feature where the upgrades reduces the number of clicks so Sam helped me do by explaining the conditionals.
Returned to code and upgrades weren't showing on the page anymore, went through the code and looked for brackets, speech marks and commas. Corrected in some places where I thought a bracket was missing. Saved changes but the upgrades still werent showing. Went into css setting dimension limits to the contrain meant they werent showing, so took them out, saved and no change. Asked in discord.
I'm sorry Joe, when picking battles with my code, making the upgrades on if one i had to compromise on. I committed the cardinal sin and had ChatGPT help me. The most annoying thing? THE CORRECTIONS WERE LITERALLY ALL THE AREAS IVE BEEN STARING AT FOR AN UNHEALTHY AMOUNT OF TIME! I EVEN DREAMT ABOUT IT. It did feel like a light bulb moment though in terms of showing me how the functions, conditionals ect all link up. I've used it as a learning experience; I've compared both codes and come up with questions around what I'm getting stuck on. When it directed me to to the issue I also tried to predict what the issue was; I wasn't far off, turns out I was getting all the function names mixedup. I had ChatGPT explain each change line by line to check if my understanding of what was missing was correct. like I also 100% think I need printouts of the demo code (but blank), illustrated to demonstrate what each piece of syntax does - syntax is the current adversary, with CSS selectors close behind. I don't regret using chatGPT, in this case, I feel like its cleared the fog - I'm just disappointed I didnt see it, HOWEVER, I'm learning so... we're being kind to ourself.
I've annotated the code with comments where the chapt GPT corrections were and left in my original code, will need to check my understand on some of these: I know what the code is doing, just not how its working - need to check what I actually need to know and what I'm overthinking.
Classmate Joe jumped in discord and gave me a really helpful tutorial on understanding grid, coded along and then used different coloured sections to help when moving everything around the page. Struggling to get the cookie clicker image into the center of the page, going through the code to see if there are any counter-productive selectors hindering the grid sections.
Upgrade button now back on the pages and showing but it says 'underdefined (cost....ect). Went back through the code looking for spelling errors and found CHATGPT MADE A SPELLING ERROR AND I FOUND IT! MWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA #CorinnaWins! I have taken photographic evidence.
Page is now displaying the correct names!
